# interview

Most interviewers tends to ask old school coding questions. Since this is the interview season, I decided to solve the "cracking the coding interview" book questions
in javascript for the sake of practice and wrapting my minds as a person coming from EE background. 

Maybe later I ll add the Python solutions for the sake of personal practice..
